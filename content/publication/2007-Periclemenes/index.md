abstract: Holthuis (1951) described Periclimenes platalea on the basis of specimens from São Vicente (Cape Verde Islands) and off French Guinea (present day Guinea). Since then the species has only been recorded from São Tiago (Cape Verde Islands) by Wirtz & d’Udekem d’Acoz (2001) and from São Tomé Island in the Gulf of Guinea (Wirtz, 2003). Although no host association was recorded in the original description (Holthuis, 1951), Wirtz & d’Udekem d’Acoz (2001) record P. platalea from Antipathes spp. (Cnidaria, Antipatharia) and Leptogorgia gaini Stiasny, 1940 (Cnidaria, Gorgonacea), whilstWirtz (2003) records the species from Leptogorgia sp. During fieldwork in Tobago in 2003, 2 male (post-orbital carapace length 1.3-1.5 mm) and 5 female (pocl 1.0-1.5 mm) specimens were collected by S. De Grave, representing the first record of this species from the western Atlantic. Specimens were collected from the hydroid, Gymnangium longicauda (Nutting, 1900), encrusted with Parazoanthus tunicans Duerden, 1900 from the western side of Big Rock, Man of War Bay, NE side of Tobago (11◦19.344N 60◦33.484W) on the 19th September 2003 at a depth of 15 m. The material has been deposited in the collections of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History (OUMNH-ZC 2004-19-002).
