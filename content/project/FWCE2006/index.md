New Zealand estuaries are increasingly impacted by catchment land-use changes. The effects include eutrophication in the form of macroalgae or phytoplankton blooms, increased organic content in sediments, loss of ecologically significant habitat including sea grass beds, and hypoxia in benthic environments. We are using sediment core data to investigate these effects to New Zealand estuaries in the recent past.
